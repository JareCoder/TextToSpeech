# TextToSpeech
A text-to-speech CLI application that goes over your text documents, finds marked phrases and turns them into .mp3 files. Uses Googles TextToSpeech API.

Made for VRETA to help them develop their VR applications much faster. A days work of hiring and scheduling a voice actor can be done in seconds!
And it all can be done from the same documents you use to plan your apporaches and type needed voice lines in!

Also utilized as a final project for graduating Kerttuli Upper Secondary.
